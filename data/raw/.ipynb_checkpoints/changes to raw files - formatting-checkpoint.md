## EXAMPLES

2019-01-14 (THM).  
- For the `Appendix A-2...xlsx` file, some of the column formats were inconsistent.  For Date ranges, used the end date.  Un merged cells and copied value down.  Fixed these and resaved as "...formatting" version.
- For the `inf_tbpf_mw and sb_survey_data_2018.xlsx` file, removed intermediate blank rows.
- For the `inf_tbpf_natural_grade...xlsx` file, fixed spelling in Elevation column name.

2019-01-15 (THM).
- For the `20180706OIP_compiled_rev.xlsx` file (renamed to `20180706OIP_compiled_rev_corrected.xlsx`):
  - on tab "Collars_Strata", added surveyed GS elevation from December 2018 for SB-1, 4, 8, and 11.  Differences ranged from -5.71 (SB-11) to -10.79 (SB-4), with SB-1 at -6.51 and SB-8 at -6.37.  There appears to be a bust with with the Dec 2018 elevation for SB-4.  SB-4 and SB-8 are close together (within about 9 feet).  Therefore, the average difference is -6.45 feet.
    - **TO DO: check the elevation of the SB locations by comparing to LIDAR data from June 2018**
  - adjusted all the elevations reference to NAVD88 by subtracting 6.45 feet for the following tabs (shown in a "Corrected_Elev (ftNAVD)" column):
    - LineLog_Strata
	- Collars_Strata
	- Sample_Strata
	- Lithology_Strata
	- RTKsurvey
- For the 2018 data cross-tab from lab, carved out the GW data and just the BTEXN columns.

2019-01-16 (THM).
- for the `20190109_tbpf_omm_data.xlsx` file added notes on the date and amount the pump intake was raised in RW-7.  Pump intake in RW-7 raised 6.5 feet to 11.14 ft.amsl on December 16.

2019-01-21 (THM).
- created a file called `fluid_level_data_2018.xlsx` that compiles all of the fluid level measurements in 2018.
- moved `20190109_tbpf_omm_data.xlsx` file information into the `fluid_level_data_2018.xlsx` file.
- added 2018 data from `tables_3_and_4_fluidlevels_historical_table.xlsx - Shortcut` file into the `fluid_level_data_2018.xlsx` file.
- added `tbl_tidal_lag_rw10_20181019.xlsx` file from emails.
- added `beach_well_gw_elev.xlsx` file.
- added `Beach.LNAPL.Gauging_20181012.xlsx` and `additional_gauging_data_20181005.xlsx` files.

2019-01-23 (THM).
- created a file called `tbpf_well_completion_info.xlsx` to compile the top of casing, ground surface, top of screen, and bottom of screen info for all wells onsite.  Screen intervals from some older wells were obtained from Table 1 of the 1996 GWM plan.
- added a file called `rw_completion_dates.xlsx` to raw data files.
- added a file called `rw_completion_dates_corrected.xlsx` to raw data files with elevation of first encountered GW.
- added pdf of the RW sampling notes from 10/16/2018 called `rw_well_sampling_10162018.pdf`, and added 10/16/18 groundwater depths in RW2 and RW7 (no product detected).
- added measurements to `fluid_level_data_2018.xlsx` file for measurements collected immediately after well installed, and for 8hrs into constant rate test on RW-7.

2019-01-24 (THM).
- added 2 files - MS access dbase created by Peter Bell of fluid levels in October 2018 and diagnostic gauge plots by Peter in October 2018.
- updated `tbpf_well_completion_info.xlsx` file for TOC elevation estimated for S101 (assumed to be a AS well) by subtracting off 6.26 feet from 2014 surveyed TOC elevation.
  - need to estimate the GS elevation for S101.

2019-01-26 (THM).
- made changes to the `fluid_level_data_2018.xlsx` file, and saved the old one.  added times to measurments when more than one on one day.  also fixed some data entry errors for the RWs.

2019-01-29 (THM).
- fixed entries in file for M-102D to correct date errors, and to add pump test measurements for RW7 and M102D with same dates/times.

2019-01-30 (THM).
- added Dec 2018 elevation data spreadsheet for comparison.
